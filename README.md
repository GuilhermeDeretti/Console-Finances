# Console-Finances
 
## Description
 
In this project we created a Financial analysis tool using javascript basic knowledge.
Provided a financial dataset we process and calculate the profit and losses to generate a log with important information for the company.
 
**Note:** This project I got to test my javascript skills and improve it, also with research, learning about a VScode built-in debugging tool for javascript which helps check the results step by step in real time.
